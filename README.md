#  DAWS BLE Communications Library

---

This library provides DAWS central and periphal BLE functions.
 It defines the server side accessory service for points etc. and provides the corresponding
 client side interface.

This library requires the "Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards" option to be installed via the Arduino IDE 
Boards Manager and subsequent selection of the "Arduino Nano 33 BLE".

The library uses Mbed/rtos functions for thread control, scheduling etc.  It is built on the Mbed
BLE API.
